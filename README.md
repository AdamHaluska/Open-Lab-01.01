Parse input string to number and check if it's less than 10.

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Open solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Open file `Exercise.cs`.
4. Implement the method `IsLessThan10(string input)` so that it parses `input` string to `int` and checks if it's less than 10.
5. Run with `CTRL+F5` to test it.
6. If all tests are passed, commit & sync your repository.
7. Send a link to your repository for Lab Master (in #slack) to check it.
